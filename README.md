# Savings_Planner_App
This Savings Planner App is designed to help users set their savings goals based on their monthly income and fixed expenses. 
The app allows users to input their desired savings goal, monthly salary, and total fixed expenses. 
Based on these inputs, it calculates and suggests three savings plans with varying levels of conservative, moderate, and aggressive. 
Each plan shows how much should be saved each month, the free money remaining after savings, and the estimated number of months required to reach the savings goal. 
Users can easily reset the inputs and recalculate the plans as needed.
